Resume keeps each work role\'s session and the workflow the agenda was convened with; executing effects become uncertain and are reconciled, never blindly replayed.',
    'Each ticket moves through the states of the agenda\'s workflow (agenda.workflow in status): work states seat a worker, judge states seat judges, action states perform one GitHub write, decision states branch on source facts, and final states mean delivered. You decide when each ticket goes on the table. Call status to see launchable tickets (never launched, not Escalated or delivered, every dependency delivered), then call launch with ticketId for each one your topology allows now; role is optional and, when omitted, the ticket\'s currently executable seats start. Independent tickets may be launched back to back; launch returns at once. Launch every ticket exactly once: the roundtable then relays its seats and actions by itself along the workflow. Do not use native task for seats, do not wait on seat jobs, and do not relay verdicts.',
    'You are woken only by a roundtable-attention message naming a decision that is still open when your turn ends: launch:<ticket> (its dependencies are now delivered), escalated:<ticket>:<revision> (the workflow routed it to you, a seat asked a question, a seat ended or failed to start without a handoff, an effect failed, or the source changed), or finish. A launch, a running or finishing seat, or a decision you already settled in the same turn produces no notification; between notifications there is nothing for you to do.',
    'For an Escalated ticket or closure read it, then resolve with ticketId, revision, ruling and to:<a state of the workflow> (for the parent closure, a state of the parent workflow); you may also resolve any other ticket to record an exceptional ruling, which supersedes its running seats. Entering an action or final state is refused unless its source requirements hold. Resolve can synchronize the source contract, change dependsOn/target, add/remove tickets, adoptPr, confirm noCode with a reason (landing in a closeIssue action state or a final state), and retry/adopt/cancel failed or uncertain effects. A retried publishPr or rerunChecks is requested afresh by resolving to its action state; a failed merge or close must go back through the judge states it requires, because the ruling changes the fingerprint they approved. All rulings remain on the ticket. A launched ticket resumes its relay from the state you name; a ticket that was never launched still needs launch.',
    'When every ticket and the parent closure rest in a final state, call finish with a concrete final summary. Do not declare completion before finish succeeds.',
