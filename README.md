# omp-roundtable

Roundtable delivers GitHub issue graphs through durable tickets that move along a configurable workflow state machine, with source-confirmed effects, one-shot seat sessions, and fresh independent judges. Main chooses which independent tickets run concurrently and which dependency edges enforce serial delivery; the workflow decides what happens to each ticket on the way.

A 4½-minute walkthrough of one real take, every model on `openai-codex/gpt-6.1-sol`. It starts with an omp session filing a feature as an issue tree: parent [#190](https://github.com/RiriAgent/rt-e2e-20260930-0931/issues/190) with native sub-issues [#186](https://github.com/RiriAgent/rt-e2e-20260930-0931/issues/186) and [#187](https://github.com/RiriAgent/rt-e2e-20260930-0931/issues/187), which are independent, [#188](https://github.com/RiriAgent/rt-e2e-20260930-0931/issues/188) with `Depends on #186`, and [#189](https://github.com/RiriAgent/rt-e2e-20260930-0931/issues/189) with `Depends on #187` and `Depends on #188`; the parent ends with the coordinator link. A click on that link on GitHub reaches the local launcher, which opens a Tern tab running `omp --roundtable RiriAgent/rt-e2e-20260930-0931#190`. Main's terminal then plays beside a ticket graph and a seat timeline drawn from the run's agenda state file and seat session logs. Every ticket passes between separate sessions: an Owner, review and accept side by side, Roundtable's own merge, then a post-merge check; the video stops on #186's relay with each seat's agent, session and duration. #186 and #187 start together, #188 starts the moment #186 is Done while #187 is still in review, and #189 waits for the later of its two dependencies; PRs #191–#194 merge and #190 closes. The video pauses and zooms at each of those moments; idle time is cut, the issue authoring plays at 6×, Main's activity at 2× and seat-only stretches at 12×.

## Starting a coordinator

A roundtable starts from the issue it delivers, never from a switch inside a session. The issue carries one link:

```
http://127.0.0.1:47591/tern/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>?cwd=<absolute local checkout>
```

GitHub strips inline `<svg>` from issue bodies, so the link is written as this repository's badge image wrapped in the link, not as a bare URL. `cwd` is percent-encoded as a query value; an unencoded space would end the Markdown link:

```markdown
[![Coordinate with Roundtable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oh-my-omp/omp-roundtable/main/docs/badge/coordinate-with-roundtable.svg)](http://127.0.0.1:47591/tern/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>?cwd=<absolute local checkout>)
```

Install the extension as an omp plugin (`omp plugin install omp-roundtable`), then install the link launcher once — from any omp session with `/roundtable-launcher install`, or from the package CLI with `omp-roundtable-launcher install`. `install` writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ohmyomp.roundtable-launcher.plist` and leaves `127.0.0.1:47591` answering; `uninstall` removes it and `status` reports it.

The launcher holds no state of its own. It reads the link, calls Tern, and returns one page naming exactly one outcome: `launched` (a coordinator tab now runs `omp --roundtable <owner>/<repo>#<number>` in the link's `cwd`), `focused` (a live block already runs that exact reference and was focused instead), `rejected` (unsupported frontend, malformed path or number, a `cwd` that is not an existing absolute directory, or a request that is not a user's click navigation), or `frontendFailed` (Tern's own output). Tern's daemon outlives its window, so the launcher opens a window in the link's `cwd` first whenever no window client is connected: a block started without one would run invisibly. Only `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` with `Sec-Fetch-User: ?1` is served, because any page can GET `127.0.0.1` and GitHub drops Referer on the https→http hop; the click is the operator's authorization. The port and the `tern` frontend are part of the published link contract.

## The coordinator

`--roundtable` is the whole identity. From `session_start`, the process's Main coordinates that issue and keeps the same native session throughout delivery. One visible startup message identifies the issue and any saved active agenda. Main reads the issue and its sub-issues, then calls the `roundtable` tool with a strict `{"input": ...}` object. Ending a coordinator means ending its omp process.

Without the flag the extension registers nothing else: no active `roundtable` tool, no timers, no roundtable state.

Main starts a new agenda with `convene`, supplying `parent` (or `null`) and `tickets`. Every ticket entry has an `id`, `issue`, `target`, `dependsOn` array, and `adoptPr` reference or `null`. All current parent sub-issues must be represented. Dependencies refer to ticket IDs; independent tickets have no edge. Main can change the topology and record exceptional rulings with `resolve`. A saved active agenda requires explicit `resume` and confirmation that the original coordinator process ended.

## Workflow

Every ticket, and the parent closure once every ticket is delivered, moves through a state machine defined by the workflow. The workflow decides which states exist, what each one does, the condition for entering it, and where each outcome leads. Code fixes only what a state kind does and the source checks no workflow can switch off. The built-in workflow is [`src/default-workflow.yml`](src/default-workflow.yml). It runs `Coding → Publishing → AwaitingChecks → Reviewing → Merging → Verifying → Closing → Done`: the Owner on `task:high`, `review` and `accept` on the PR, `postMerge` on the merge commit, and `closure` on the parent on `task:mid`. Failing CI, a conflict, or a rejected review returns the ticket to `Coding`.

| Kind | What it does | Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| `work` | seats one `role` with its `agent` and `brief`; the seat pushes a branch and calls `submit`; a later seat of the same role forks that role's session | `submitted`, `escalated` |
| `judge` | seats every listed judge on a `subject`: `pullRequest` (the exact PR head) or `mergeCommit` (the exact merge commit); parent judges check out the first ticket's target branch | `passed` (every judge passed; an empty list passes at once), `rejected` (any judge failed), `escalated` |
| `action` | performs one GitHub write and waits for GitHub to confirm it: `publishPr`, `merge`, `closeIssue`, `rerunChecks` (every failing Actions run of the PR; with none it escalates); parent: `closeParent` | `done` |
| `decision` | moves to the first branch whose condition holds, re-checked on every refresh; an unconditional last branch `{to}` is its fallback, and without one it waits | its branch targets |
| `final` | delivered | none |

An outcome leads to a state, to `escalate` (Main's ruling, the `Escalated` state), or to a branch list `[{when, to}, ..., {to}]` whose first matching branch wins and whose last entry is the fallback. Any state may declare an entry condition `when` with a fallback `otherwise`: whichever outcome or ruling targets the state, the ticket enters it only while `when` holds, and goes to `otherwise` instead. Conditions read only source-confirmed facts and the machine's own history: `{checks: passing|failing|pending|unknown}`, `{mergeable: 'yes'|'no'|behind|draft|unknown}` (quote `yes` and `no` in YAML), `{visits: {state, atLeast}}` for how often a state was entered, and `{all}`, `{any}`, `{not}`. The parent machine has no PR, so it uses only `visits` and the combinators. A `pullRequest` judge, a `merge` action, and a ticket decision may declare `observe`. While the ticket holds an open PR in that state, `checksFailed`, `conflict`, `behind`, and `drift` (a new head, title, or description) lead where `observe` says, and to `escalate` when it says nothing. A PR that is closed, retargeted, a draft, or no longer closes exactly its issue, and checks that cannot be read, always escalate.

`ticket.initial` is the work state a convened ticket starts in, and the state Main launches. A ticket convened with `adoptPr` starts in `ticket.adopted.pullRequest` when the PR is open and in `ticket.adopted.mergeCommit` when it is already merged; it has not visited the initial state. `parent.initial` is entered once every ticket is delivered, and again whenever the delivered children change.

This workflow adds a security judge that runs only on the first round, routes a security rejection to Main instead of back to rework, and verifies the merge only for reworked tickets:

```yaml
ticket:
  initial: Build
  adopted: {pullRequest: WaitCi, mergeCommit: Close}
  states:
    Build: {kind: work, role: builder, agent: task:high, brief: Deliver the issue., on: {submitted: Open, escalated: escalate}}
    Open: {kind: action, action: publishPr, on: {done: WaitCi}}
    WaitCi:
      kind: decision
      branches: [{when: {all: [{checks: passing}, {mergeable: 'yes'}]}, to: Security}]
      observe: {checksFailed: Build, conflict: Build, behind: Build, drift: WaitCi}
    Security:
      kind: judge
      subject: pullRequest
      when: {not: {visits: {state: Build, atLeast: 2}}}
      otherwise: Quality
      judges: [{role: security, agent: task:mid, brief: Check for injection and leaked secrets.}]
      observe: {checksFailed: Build, conflict: Build, behind: Build, drift: WaitCi}
      on: {passed: Quality, rejected: escalate, escalated: escalate}
    Quality:
      kind: judge
      subject: pullRequest
      judges: [{role: quality, agent: task:mid, brief: Check correctness and tests.}]
      observe: {checksFailed: Build, conflict: Build, behind: Build, drift: WaitCi}
      on: {passed: Ship, rejected: Build, escalated: escalate}
    Ship:
      kind: action
      action: merge
      requires: [Quality]
      observe: {checksFailed: Build, conflict: Build, behind: Build}
      on: {done: [{when: {visits: {state: Build, atLeast: 2}}, to: Deploy}, {to: Close}]}
    Deploy: {kind: judge, subject: mergeCommit, judges: [{role: deploy, agent: task:mid, brief: Verify the merged change.}], on: {passed: Close, rejected: escalate, escalated: escalate}}
    Close: {kind: action, action: closeIssue, on: {done: Delivered}}
    Delivered: {kind: final}
parent:
  initial: Release
  states:
    Release: {kind: judge, judges: [{role: release, agent: task:mid, brief: Verify the parent is delivered.}, {role: compliance, agent: task:mid, brief: Check the delivery against the release policy.}], on: {passed: CloseParent, rejected: escalate, escalated: escalate}}
    CloseParent: {kind: action, action: closeParent, requires: [Release], on: {done: Finished}}
    Finished: {kind: final}
```

- **Merging:** `merge` waits until the PR is mergeable with passing required checks and every dependency is delivered. It then needs a passed approval, on the current PR fingerprint, from every judge state named in `requires` and from every PR judge state the ticket still holds. A drift drops all PR approvals.
- **Closing:** `closeIssue` needs a Main `noCode` ruling on the current contract, or a merge still contained in the target with its `requires` approvals. `closeParent` needs the current children fingerprint with its approvals.
- **Final states:** a ticket stays in a final state only while its issue is closed and its merge or `noCode` ruling still holds. The parent closure stays in one only while the parent issue is closed and its children are the ones judged. Otherwise they escalate. Dependencies, the parent closure, and `finish` count a ticket as delivered when it rests in a final state.
- **Main's override:** these source checks bind Main's `resolve` too, but judge states do not. Main may resolve a ticket or the closure into a later state, including a final one, without its judges once the source facts hold; that is an explicit ruling, recorded on the ticket.
- **Failures:** a judge state that did not pass keeps no approval. A GitHub write that fails or has an unknown outcome always escalates to Main.
- **Revisions:** every state entry starts a new ticket revision, so a seat of the previous entry is superseded. A state that completes at once, such as an empty judge list or a matching decision, moves on immediately. A machine that passes 64 states without waiting escalates as a loop.

The loader refuses unknown fields, unknown targets, unreachable states, cycles of entry fallbacks, an initial state that is not an unguarded `work` state, a machine without a final state, a parent condition that reads the PR, a judge role used twice or shared with a work role, a work role with two agents, a `requires` naming the wrong kind of judge, a missing outcome, and the reserved names `escalate` and `Escalated`. Role and state names start with a letter and use letters, digits, `_`, or `-`. A `brief` is the seat's duty. The roundtable adds the protocol to it: ticket scope, what the checkout is, the exact `submit` or `verdict` call, and that the workflow decides what follows. An `agent` is a native agent name, resolved the way `task` resolves it in the coordinator's `cwd`, and must be non-blocking.

`convene` reads the workflow from `roundtable.workflowFile` (env `OMP_ROUNDTABLE_WORKFLOW`, relative to the coordinator's `cwd`), which must exist. When that setting is unset, it reads `<roundtable.dataDir>/workflow.yml`, falling back to the built-in workflow when the file does not exist. An unreadable or invalid file, or an agent that cannot host a seat, refuses `convene`. The agenda freezes the workflow it was convened with: relays, rework, and `resume` never read the file again, so edits apply to the next `convene`.

## Ticket handoff

Main decides only when each ticket goes on the table. `status` returns the agenda, including its workflow, with the `launchable` tickets (never launched, neither `Escalated` nor delivered, every dependency delivered) and the seats currently `seated`. Main calls `launch` with `ticketId` and an optional `role`, once per ticket; an omitted `role` means the ticket's currently executable seats, and a given `role` must be one of them. The call marks the ticket started, seats its current state at once, and returns their native async job IDs, so independent tickets can be launched back to back. From then on the roundtable follows the workflow by itself: it seats each work and judge state, performs each action, and evaluates each decision, including the parent machine once every ticket is delivered. A seat is one-shot per revision: a role seated at a revision is never seated at that revision again within the process, so a seat that ends without a handoff is followed by its escalation, not by a replacement. A work seat starts only after every seat of its ticket has exited. Native `task` is not used for these seats because its session allocator cannot accept a work-session fork manager.

Main is woken by a `roundtable-attention` message only for a decision it has not yet been told about and that is still open when its current turn ends: a ticket that became launchable, an `Escalated` ticket or closure (keyed by revision), or a finished agenda awaiting `finish`. A decision Main settles within the turn that produced it, such as launching what `convene` unlocked, never wakes it again. Launching, running seats, seat job completions, and effects in flight do not notify.

Each seat reads only its bound ticket through `read`. A work seat pushes its code branch and calls `submit` with the ticket revision, branch, head, title, and a PR body closing exactly that issue. A judge calls `verdict` with its own `role`; findings land on the ticket's notes. A seat calls `escalate` for a question, blocker, proposed split, or no-code finding, which follows its state's `escalated` outcome. A successful handoff ends the seat; it does not wait for another assignment.

A seat that ends at its current revision without a handoff, or cannot be started, escalates its ticket instead of being relaunched. Main handles `Escalated` tickets, and records exceptional rulings on any other ticket or the closure, with `resolve`, naming the state to continue in with `to` (a parent workflow state for the closure). A resolution starts a new revision, so the seats of the state it replaces are superseded. `resolve` records a persistent ruling, synchronizes the issue contract, adjusts topology, adopts source results, or settles a failed or uncertain effect. `retry` adopts the effect if GitHub already shows it and otherwise cancels it. Resolving to the action state requests it afresh. A `publishPr` or `rerunChecks` can be retried that way directly. A `merge` or `closeIssue` cannot: the ruling changes the fingerprint its judges approved, so it has to go back through those judge states. The target is entered through its entry condition, and `resolve` is refused when that entry escalates, for example a `merge` state without the approvals it requires, or a final state whose issue is still open. Main confirms no-code work with `noCode` and a `to` whose entry lands in a `closeIssue` action state or a final state; the ticket is delivered only after GitHub confirms the closure. `resolve` may queue only `replaceBody`, `createIssue`, `attachChild`, and `rerunChecks` for a ticket, and nothing for the closure; publishing, merging, and closing belong to the workflow's action states. A started ticket resumes its relay from the named state. A changed `target` drops the ticket's work sessions, so the next work seat checks out the new target. `finish` records the final summary only after every ticket and the parent closure rest in a final state. A parent final state also needs the parent issue closed.

## Sessions and recovery

Every seat checkout is a detached `git worktree` of a per-repository bare cache under `<roundtable.dataDir>/repos`, which is cloned once and fetched before each checkout; seats never clone from the network. Worktrees live under `<roundtable.dataDir>/worktrees/<agendaId>`. A work role's first seat receives a new persistent native session and a checkout of the target branch; the ticket records that role's accepted session in `sessions`. A later seat of the role forks it with `SessionManager.forkFrom` in the same checkout, repairing an interrupted transcript tail and resetting inherited cost, then gives that manager to `createAgentSession`. A role's first seat records its base system prompt and its tool presentation (enabled tools and the subset mounted as `xd://` devices) in a `roundtable-session-contract` entry. The fork restores both and explicitly inherits the provider prompt-cache key. It clears the inherited todo list and appends only the incremental notes and rulings to the new turn. A fork source whose contract lacks the tool presentation cannot be forked, so its ticket escalates. Actual provider cache hits still depend on the provider; preserving a key is not a measured hit-rate guarantee.

Every seat is a full native omp session in its checkout, not a restricted one. It binds the extensions Main loaded (user plugins, configured extensions, and their extension roots), reads the workspace's settings, discovers the workspace's custom tools, shares Main's MCP servers, and keeps every tool those provide, including `todo`, `task`, and replacements such as `exec_command` for `bash`. Its seat agent may delegate to helper agents (`spawns` follows the agent definition, `*` when unspecified). Only the seat's own session is bound to its ticket: the `roundtable` tool it receives reads and hands off that ticket, while helpers it spawns have their own native identities and are refused as seats. Seats run headless, so tool approvals are not prompted, and they never join IRC: a seat reaches Main only through its ticket. Extensions bind from Main's process rather than being rediscovered, so project-local extensions or MCP servers of a different target repository are not loaded into its seats.

Judge seats always receive new blank sessions; their histories are never reused or forked. `pullRequest` judges check out exactly the PR head their gate stamp names (fetched through the PR's pull ref, so fork heads work), `mergeCommit` judges check out exactly the merge commit, and parent judges check out the first ticket's target branch; the host verifies the checkout's `HEAD` before the seat starts. A parent judge's brief carries the closure record (its children's issues, terminals and targets, rulings and notes), not the parent or child issue bodies, and its checkout covers only that one target even when the children span several. A superseded seat ends at its next native tool-completion boundary instead of retrying another revision's work; accepted handoffs finish normally so their checkpoints remain intact. `mergeCommit` fingerprints pin the ticket's merge commit and freshly verify target containment, so unrelated forward merges do not invalidate a running verification. Seat sessions are disposed when their native async jobs finish. Work checkouts survive process restarts and rework until `finish`; judge worktrees are removed when their jobs end. Session files remain under `<roundtable.dataDir>/sessions/<agendaId>`.

Accepted transitions and effect intents are durably saved under `<roundtable.dataDir>/state` before returning. Every external write first persists `executing`, performs the operation, then confirms its result through a fresh GitHub read. An unknown outcome becomes `uncertain` and is never automatically resent. Resume reconciles interrupted executing intents against GitHub rather than replaying them. Every effect records the state entry that requested it. A ready effect is cancelled once that entry is left, and a late confirmation records its result without moving a newer state. PR head, target, issue contract, PR body, or ruling changes invalidate approvals before any merge.

State envelopes use `format: 7`, which carries the agenda's frozen workflow in file shape. Older formats are rejected without migration or deletion. State saves sync the owned state directory, not its ancestors. The extension never rewrites conversation history or injects per-turn hidden ticket context; ticket reads and visible notifications are ordinary messages.

## State-flow simulation

`bun run sim [scenario...]` runs the real `omp` binary in RPC mode with this extension, its controller, seat host, git worktrees, native sessions and forks. Only the model and GitHub are simulated: `tests/sim/extension.ts` registers a scripted `sim` provider that plays Main and every seat from what omp actually sends it, and `tests/sim/github-sim.ts` answers the real `src/ports/github.ts` through a `gh` shim placed first on `PATH`, backed by local bare repositories for every git fact and failing loudly on any request it does not model. Each scenario supplies its workflow as `<roundtable.dataDir>/workflow.yml`, with every seat agent defined as a scripted agent; all but `flow` use the built-in workflow. Scenarios run in scratch directories under `/tmp/rt-sim-*` and need no network:

- `tree`: seven tickets with parallel, serial, gate rejection with forked rework, escalation with a ruling, noCode through `Closing`, and the parent closure. Every seat must record `task` and `roundtable` with `spawns` `*`, and each rework fork must keep its first Owner's prompt-cache key and clear the inherited todo list.
- `ci`: required checks that stay pending hold the ticket in `AwaitingChecks`; a failing check returns it to `Coding` for a forked rework.
- `head`: a new head pushed to an open PR while both judges are seated restarts review on the new head without escalating.
- `abandon`: an Owner that ends without a handoff escalates once and is seated again only after Main's ruling.
- `restart`: the process is killed while a handed-off Owner is mid-tool, and the workflow file is rewritten to a different roster; after `resume`, the agenda keeps its frozen workflow, and the rework fork repairs the interrupted tail and resets inherited cost.
- `flow`: the custom workflow above with scripted agents, over three tickets and a parent. `F1` passes `Security` and `Quality` and goes straight to `Close`. `F2` is rejected by `Quality`, reworks, skips `Security` on its entry condition, and passes `Deploy` on the post-merge branch. `F3` is rejected by `Security` and goes straight to Main, which resolves it to `Build`. Every seat runs its configured agent and carries only its own duty, and the parent machine finishes through both `Release` judges.

Each scenario also checks that Main launched every ticket exactly once, was never woken for a decision it had already taken, that every expected judge's accepted verdict sat on the exact commit its subject names, and that the simulated repository ends in the expected state.
